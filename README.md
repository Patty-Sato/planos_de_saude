# Health Care Plan

Python Program for Health Care Plan Complaints

The activity consists of a program to collect information about consumer complaints from health care plan operators, which should collect the following: 
<br>
Operator’s name; <br>
Customer’s name; <br>
Reason for complaint 
<br>
The program should be prepared to deal with 5 different operators, and for each operator, register the customers and their complaints. As the number of customers and complaints is not known in advance, the program asks if there are more customers and complaints to be registered for each operator. For each registered operator, the program displays the operator’s name, the customer’s name, and the reason for the complaint. When all complaints from an operator have been registered, the program displays the total number of complaints for that operator. In the end, it reports the overall total of registered complaints.
